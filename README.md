# Semantic text similarity on short text segments

# Summary

Building on the [Semantic Text Similarity datasets](http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/stswiki/index.php/Main_Page) of SemEval,
this repository seeks to evaluate computationally-efficient approaches to identify short text segments
that have nearly the same semantic meaning in large-scale datasets.

# Getting started

The main entry point to the code in this repository is ``test_textsim.py``.
That file contains fuller comments describing the approaches being evaluated.

# Contact

Further information is available from Scott Hale. Meedan team members can 
contact Scott via Slack and others can reach out to Scott via comments/issues
on this repository or via [direct message on Twitter](https://twitter.com/computermacgyve)
